    </div>
    <div class="text_area">
        <p> Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale
            of rebellion, extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims
            of his school P.E. teacher as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a
            teenage boy with no measurable upper-body strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers
            of the district. However, the system failed him as he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates
            of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and
            started to work as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur railway station to make ends meet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu Rajput family to Pan Singh and
            Devaki Devi. His parents hailed from Lwali village in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the
            youngest of three children. His family spells the surname as "Dhauni". The spelling "Dhoni"
            emerged due to a spelling mistake in his school certificates and, despite repeated attempts by his family,
            has never been rectified.

            Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he started playing football as a goal keeper but
            later moved to play cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee. From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni
            worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern Railway zone of Indian
            Railways.</p>

    <div class="text_area flex">
        <img class="about_pic1" src="assets/about_pic1.jpg">
        <p> He played as a wicket-keeper for Commando cricket club from 1995 to 1998 and Central Coal Fields Limited
            (CCL) team in 1998. At CCL, he batted higher up the order and helped the team qualify to the higher
            division. Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season of Vinoo Mankad
            Trophy under-16 championship. In the 1998-99, Dhoni played for Bihar U-19 team in the Cooch Behar
            Trophy and scored 176 runs in 5 matches. In the 1999-2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team
            made it to the finals, where Dhoni made 84 in a losing cause. Dhoni's contribution in the tournament
            included 488 runs in nine matches with five fifties, 17 catches and seven stumpings. Dhoni made it to
            the East Zone U-19 squad for the C. K. Nayudu Trophy in the 1999-2000 season and scored only 97 runs in four
            matches, as East Zone lost all the matches and finished last in the tournament.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> After completing his schooling in Ranchi, MS Dhoni moved to Kharagpur to pursue his higher studies. It was
            during this time that he applied for a job as a ticket collector with the Indian Railways. Although he was
            selected for the job, he had to undergo rigorous training before he could start working.

            As a ticket collector, he was responsible for checking passengers' tickets and ensuring that they had
            paid the correct fare. He had to work long hours and deal with irate passengers, but he took it all in his
            stride. Despite the challenges, he never lost his calm demeanor, and his pleasant personality won him many
            admirers.

            During his free time, he would often be seen playing cricket with his friends. He had a natural talent
            for the game, and it wasn't long before he was noticed by the local cricket coach. The coach recognized his
            potential and urged him to pursue cricket seriously.</p>

        <p> MS Dhoni, who is among India's most renowned cricketers, had a remarkable Test match career. In December
            2005, he made his Test debut against Sri Lanka. He played for India for 90 Tests until he retired from the
            format in December 2014. Dhoni scored 4,876 runs as a wicketkeeper-batsman, with an average of 38.09,
            including 6 centuries and 33 half-centuries. In 2013, he scored the highest score of 224 against
            Australia.Dhoni was famous for his sharp cricketing mind and calm demeanor। He was one of India's best Test
            captains, having led the country in 60 Test matches, winning 27, losing 18, and drawing 15. Under his
            leadership,
            India reached the first place in the ICC Test rankings in 2009. Dhoni's leadership was marked by his
            strategic acumen and ability to get the best out of his players,
            particularly in challenging conditions. Dhoni's legacy in Test format as a Captain was absolutely brilliant.

        <p> Mahendra Singh Dhoni made his Test debut for India on December 2, 2005, against Sri Lanka in Chennai. Known
            primarily for his explosive batting in limited-overs formats at that time, there was curiosity about how he
            would adapt to the longer format of the game. In his debut Test, Dhoni didn't have a remarkable start with
            the bat, scoring 30 runs in the only innings
            India played. He batted lower down the order, which became typical of his role early on in Test cricket. His
            wicketkeeping, however, drew attention, as he showcased his agility behind the stumps, further strengthening
            his case as India's first-choice keeper-batsman. Although his debut wasn't extraordinary, Dhoni would go on
            to become a vital player for India in Tests,
            eventually becoming the team's captain in 2008. Under his leadership, India reached the No. 1 spot in the
            ICC Test rankings for the first time in their history. He retired from Test cricket in December 2014 after
            playing 90 matches, where he scored 4,876 runs, including 6 centuries. Dhoni's legacy in Test cricket is
            defined by his calm leadership and astute strategies, especially in pressure situations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> MS Dhoni's highest score in Test cricket came against Australia at Chennai in February 2013, during the
            first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
            224 vs Australia, Chennai (2013)
            In this match Dhoni scored 224 crucial runs and make his highest score in the format as winning edge.
            His knock included 24 boundaries and 6 sixes, showing a mix of power and precision.
            Dhoni's partnership with Virat Kohli (who scored 107) helped India recover and eventually take control of
            the match.
            India won the match comfortably by 8 wickets, and Dhoni was named the Player of the Match for his incredible
            performance.
            This knock was a testament to Dhoni's ability to dominate even in the longer format, and it remains his only
            double-century in Test cricket. His 224 was crucial in setting the tone for India's 4-0 series victory over
            Australia in that series.</p>

        <p> Dhoni played his last series during India's tour of Australia in December 2014. Following the third Test in
            Melbourne, Dhoni announced his retirement from the format. In his last test, he effected nine dismissals
            (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past Kumar Sangakkara's record for most stumpings
            in international cricket and also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an Indian
            wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018. In the Carlton Mid triangular series in
            Australia, India failed to win a single match with Dhoni himself managing just 70 runs from three innings at
            an average of 23.34. After the Succesful 9 years of team player and Captain, Dhoni goodbye to test cricket
            with watery eyes. </p>

    <div class="text_area">
        <p> Mahendra Singh Dhoni, often referred to as MS Dhoni, had an illustrious ODI career for India from 2004 to
            2019. Known for his calm demeanor, tactical acumen, and finishing abilities, Dhoni was instrumental in many
            of India's triumphs. He played 350 ODIs, scoring 10,773 runs at an average of 50.57, including 10 centuries
            and 73 fifties. Dhoni captained India to victory in the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup,
            and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Renowned for his finishing skills, Dhoni remained not out 84 times in ODIs, a
            testament to his ability to close out matches. In addition to his batting and captaincy, Dhoni's
            wicketkeeping was world-class. He holds the record for the most stumpings in ODIs (123), showcasing his
            quick reflexes behind the stumps. Dhoni retired from international cricket in 2020, but his
            contributions to Indian cricket, especially in the ODI format, remain legendary. His impact on the game,
            both as a player and a leader, continues to inspire generations.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> MS Dhoni made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India on December 23, 2004, in a match against
            Bangladesh in Chittagong. Coming in as a wicketkeeper-batsman, his debut innings was far from spectacular—he
            was run out for a duck (0) after facing just one ball. Despite the disappointing start, Dhoni's aggressive
            batting style and sharp wicketkeeping skills soon caught the attention of cricket fans and selectors alike.

            It wasn't long after his debut that Dhoni found his rhythm, particularly with his explosive knock of 148
            against Pakistan in 2005, just his fifth ODI. This innings marked the beginning of a stellar ODI career that
            saw him become one of the most dependable and iconic players in world cricket.

            Though his debut match was unremarkable, Dhoni quickly turned things around, evolving into one of India's
            greatest cricketers in the ODI format.</p>

        <p>One of MS Dhoni's best performances in ODIs came on October 31, 2005, against Sri Lanka in Jaipur, where he
            played a breathtaking knock of 183* off 145 balls. Chasing a challenging target of 299, India found
            themselves in early trouble. Dhoni, batting at number three, took control of the innings, hammering 15 fours
            and 10 sixes in a dominating display of power and composure. His unbeaten 183 remains the highest score by a
            wicketkeeper in ODI history.

            This innings not only helped India win the match by six wickets with 23 balls to spare but also solidified
            Dhoni's reputation as an exceptional finisher. It showcased his ability to absorb pressure, accelerate the
            run rate, and guide India to victory. His performance was a perfect blend of aggression and smart cricket,
            reflecting the qualities that later defined his legendary career.

            While this knock is widely regarded as his best, Dhoni's many match-winning innings-especially in tight run
            chases-cemented his legacy as one of the greatest ODI batsmen and finishers in cricket history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> One of the defining moments of MS Dhoni's career came in the final of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup on
            April 2, 2011, at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. India was chasing a target of 275 set by Sri Lanka. After
            losing key wickets early, India was under pressure at 114 for 3 when Dhoni made a bold decision to promote
            himself up the order, ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh.

            Dhoni came in at number five and played a match-winning knock of 91 off 79 balls*. His innings was a
            masterclass in chasing under pressure. He steadied the Indian innings alongside Gautam Gambhir, who scored a
            vital 97. Dhoni's ability to rotate the strike and find the boundaries at crucial moments kept India in the
            hunt. The highlight of the match came when Dhoni sealed the victory with a towering six over long-on off
            Nuwan Kulasekara, leading India to their first World Cup title in 28 years.

            His unbeaten 91 earned him the Player of the Match award, and his calm leadership throughout the tournament
            solidified his status as one of the best captains in cricket history. This World Cup triumph was a crowning
            moment for Dhoni, cementing his legacy as a legendary cricketer and an iconic captain who led India to the
            pinnacle of ODI cricket.</p>

        <p> MS Dhoni's leadership reached another high point during the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, held in England.
            India faced hosts England in the final on June 23, 2013, at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Due to rain, the match
            was reduced to 20 overs per side. India batted first and managed to score a modest total of 129/7 in 20
            overs, with Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja contributing crucial runs.

            Defending a low total, Dhoni's captaincy brilliance came to the forefront. He marshaled his bowlers
            superbly, mixing up the field placements and tactics in the tense, rain-shortened final. With wickets
            tumbling, Dhoni backed his spinners, especially Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, to stifle England’s
            chase. In a thrilling finish, England needed 20 runs off 16 balls with four wickets in hand, but Dhoni’s
            smart decision-making turned the match around.

            India bowled out England for 124, winning the match by just 5 runs. With this victory, Dhoni became the
            first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies—T20 World Cup (2007), ODI World Cup (2011), and
            Champions Trophy (2013). Dhoni's calm demeanor and tactical brilliance under pressure played a pivotal role
            in India's success, reinforcing his reputation as one of the greatest captains in ODI history.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text_area flex">
        <p> MS Dhoni's last ODI match for India took place on July 9, 2019, during the semi-final of the ICC Cricket
            World Cup against New Zealand at Old Trafford, Manchester. The match was spread over two days due to rain,
            and India, chasing a target of 240, found themselves in deep trouble at 92 for 6.

            Dhoni, coming in at number seven, once again tried to rescue the team with his experience and calm approach.
            He formed a crucial partnership with Ravindra Jadeja, who played a brilliant attacking knock. Dhoni,
            however, played the role of an anchor, keeping the innings steady as India edged closer to the target.

            With India needing 25 runs from 10 balls, Dhoni's attempt to take the game deep ended when he was run out
            for 50 after a sharp throw from Martin Guptill. His dismissal effectively sealed India’s fate, and they
            eventually lost by 18 runs, bowing out of the tournament.

            This match marked Dhoni's final appearance in an ODI for India. Though the outcome wasn't in his favor, his
            fighting half-century in a pressure situation was a testament to the resilience and grit that defined his
            career. Dhoni retired from international cricket on August 15, 2020, leaving behind a legacy that few

        <p> MS Dhoni, one of the most iconic figures in cricket, had an illustrious T20 International (T20I) career. He
            made his T20I debut in 2006 and quickly became a pivotal player for India in the shortest format of the
            game. Known for his calm demeanor and sharp cricketing mind, Dhoni led India to victory in the inaugural ICC
            T20 World Cup in 2007, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest captains in T20I history.

            Throughout his T20I career, Dhoni played 98 matches, scoring 1,617 runs with an average of 37.60 and a
            strike rate of 126.13. While not the most aggressive batsman, his ability to finish games under pressure
            made him a crucial asset for India. He was also one of the finest wicketkeepers in T20 cricket, holding the
            record for the most stumpings in T20Is (34) and taking 57 catches.

            Beyond his personal achievements, Dhoni was a brilliant tactician, often outsmarting opponents with his
            strategic decisions. Even after stepping down as captain in 2017, he continued to be a valuable mentor to
            the team, guiding younger players with his experience and leadership.

            Dhoni retired from international T20 cricket in 2020, leaving behind a legacy that few can match. His

        <p> MS Dhoni's T20 International (T20I) debut on December 1, 2006, against South Africa in Johannesburg was a
            historic moment for Indian cricket, as it marked the team's entry into the shortest format of the game. In
            this debut match, Dhoni didn't get much chance to showcase his skills with the bat, out on
            0 in 2 balls, but India comfortably won the match by six wickets. While his individual debut performance was
            quiet, Dhoni's leadership skills and cricketing acumen would soon
            become pivotal in India's T20 journey. Less than a year after his debut, Dhoni was handed the captaincy for
            the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, where he led a young Indian team to a memorable victory. This
            triumph not only solidified Dhoni's reputation as a tactically brilliant leader but also laid the foundation
            for India's dominance in T20 cricket. His debut, though modest, was the beginning of a

        <p> The 2007 ICC T20 World Cup was a defining moment in MS Dhoni's career and Indian cricket history. It was
            Dhoni's first major assignment as captain, and he led a relatively young and inexperienced Indian side to an
            unexpected but spectacular triumph. Under his calm and composed leadership, India overcame strong teams like
            South Africa, Australia, and arch-rivals Pakistan, displaying a fearless and aggressive brand of cricket.
            In the final match against Pakistan, India scored 157, and Pakistan came close to chasing it down. However,
            Dhoni's decision to give Joginder Sharma the responsibility of the last over paid off as India won by 5
            runs, sealing the first-ever T20 World Cup title. This win not only established Dhoni as a leader who
            thrived under pressure but also sparked the growth of T20 cricket in India, leading to the rise of the IPL.
            The 2007 T20 World Cup victory was the first of many major triumphs for Dhoni as a captain and remains one
            of the most memorable moments in his illustrious career.</p>

        <p> MS Dhoni played his last T20 International (T20I) on February 27, 2019, against Australia in Bengaluru. In
            what would become his final appearance in the shortest format for India, Dhoni displayed his usual calm and
            composed self on the field. Batting at No. 5, Dhoni scored 40 off 23 balls, playing a vital role in India
            posting a competitive total of 190/4. His innings was a classic Dhoni knock, combining quick singles with
            powerful shots, including three sixes.
            This game marked the end of Dhoni's illustrious T20I career, spanning 98 matches, 1,617 runs, and countless
            contributions as a wicketkeeper and leader. While he did not officially announce his retirement from T20Is
            until August 15, 2020, this match was his last appearance in the format. Dhoni's departure from the T20I
            stage left a void, but his legacy as one of India's greatest T20 players and captains endures.

        <p> MS Dhoni's Indian Premier League (IPL) career is legendary, both for his individual performances and his
            leadership. Since the inaugural season in 2008, Dhoni has been synonymous with the Chennai Super Kings
            (CSK), captaining the team in almost every season. Under his leadership, CSK has become one of the most
            successful franchises, winning five IPL titles (2010, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2023) and making it to the
            playoffs nearly every year. His calmness, tactical brilliance, and ability to make decisions under pressure
            are key reasons for CSK's success.

            As a batsman, Dhoni is known for his finishing ability in tight chases. He has scored over 5,000 runs in the
            IPL with a healthy average of around 40 and a strike rate exceeding 135. His ability to stay composed and
            accelerate at the right time has earned him the title of one of the best finishers in IPL history. Dhoni has
            played numerous match-winning innings, especially in tense situations, helping CSK secure many memorable
            victories.

            Even during the two years when CSK was suspended (2016 and 2017), Dhoni continued to lead with grace,
            playing for Rising Pune Supergiant. Upon his return to CSK, Dhoni immediately guided the team to an IPL
            title in 2018, proving his enduring influence.

            Dhoni's legacy in the IPL is one of unmatched leadership, consistency, and success. His association with CSK
            and the fanbase he has built have made him an iconic figure in the league, and his contributions continue to
            define his illustrious IPL career.

        <p> MS Dhoni made his IPL debut on April 19, 2008, playing for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the inaugural match
            of the league against Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings). Dhoni, who had recently led India to victory in
            the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup, was the most expensive player in the first IPL auction, with CSK buying him for
            a record $1.5 million. In his debut match, Dhoni didn't need to do much with the bat as CSK posted a massive
            total of 240/5, with
            Michael Hussey scoring a blistering century. Dhoni contributed 2* off 3 balls as CSK won the game by 33
            runs. However, his leadership was evident from the beginning as he marshaled his resources effectively on
            the field. That first game in 2008 was just the start of Dhoni's iconic journey in the IPL, where he would
            go on to
            become one of the most celebrated figures in the tournament's history.</p>
